Testing custom malloc and free implementations...

Heap State:
Chunk 0: Address: 0x1048d0008, Size: 64, Status: Free

Task 1 (malloc/free 1-byte object 120 times): 4 microseconds (avg over 50 runs)
Task 2 (malloc 120 objects, then free them all): 1200 microseconds (avg over 50 runs)
Task 3 (random malloc/free): 1093 microseconds (avg over 50 runs)
